# Blind 75 LeetCode Solutions

A systematic approach to mastering the Blind 75 problem set through deep understanding, not memorization.

## About This Repository

This repository documents my 45-day journey through the Blind 75 LeetCode problems. Each solution includes detailed comments explaining the thought process, pattern recognition, and time/space complexity analysis.

The goal is not to solve problems quickly, but to understand them deeply enough to solve similar problems independently.

## Approach

For each problem, I follow this method:

1. Attempt the problem without assistance for 20 minutes
2. If stuck, study the solution and understand the underlying pattern
3. Close all references and rewrite the solution from memory
4. Add comments explaining each section of the code
5. Repeat until I can solve it cold

When multiple approaches exist, both solutions are included in the same file with explanations of the tradeoffs.
